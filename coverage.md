# Statement, Branch, and Predicate Coverage Learning Outputs
In today's lecture, we covered the important concepts of statement, branch, and predicate coverage in software testing. 
Here are some of the key takeaways and learning outputs:
## Statement coverage
Statement Coverage is a white box testing technique in which all the executable statements in the source code are executed at least once. 
It is used for calculation of the number of statements in source code which have been executed. 
The main purpose of Statement Coverage is to cover all the possible paths, lines and statements in source code.
## Branch Coverage
Branch Coverage is a white box testing method in which every outcome from a code module(statement or loop) is tested. 
The purpose of branch coverage is to ensure that each decision condition from every branch is executed at least once. \
It helps to measure fractions of independent code segments and to find out sections having no branches.

## Predicate Coverage:

Predicate coverage focuses on testing the conditions within decision points, including all possible combinations.
